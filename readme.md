This is a based on the HTML5 Boilerplate, using CSS3 to drive the animations of each of the squares. It is also using jQuery to copy the animations. The way I designed it was to use the Modernizr to test the capability of the current browser, and if it was a recent version of a modern browser (for example Google Chrome) it would use the CSS3, otherwise it would use the jQuery to animate.
